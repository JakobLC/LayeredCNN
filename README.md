This repository can be used to look at some of the code aswell as a trained model from the paper "LayeredCNN: Segmenting Layers with Autoregressive Models". 
The LayeredCNN models are implemented in models.py. 

A 5 MB trained model is included in models/ and a simple script demonstrates its uses in tutorial.py. 
The tutorial.py script should be able to run from start to finish if the repository is pulled and dependencies are installed (such as pytorch). 
It includes a very simple synthetic data generation that you can play with to generate data, and subsequently segment the data and show results.
